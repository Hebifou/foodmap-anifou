Concept

The **Foodmap App** is an experimental Streamlit prototype  
that connects **nutrition data with a human body visualization.  
Each selected food highlights the body regions it supports —  
from brain and skin to digestion and circulation.

It’s not a finished product, but a creative exploration of  
how **data and design** can make nutrition knowledge more intuitive.
